          <p class="justify p-3">Matthew J. Olson serves as Director of Choral Activities at Carleton College (MN)
            where he leads the choirs, instructs voice lessons, and teaches courses in conducting and a cappella
            arranging. Formerly, he served as Associate Conductor of The Singers – Minnesota Choral Artists, and
            founding Artistic Director of Bach Roots Festival whose performances of major choral-orchestral works were
            hailed as “masterful” and “gripping” (The Minnesota Star Tribune).  </p>
          <p class="justify p-3">In his role with The Singers, he served
            as chorusmaster with The St. Paul Chamber Orchestra on multiple collaborations including performances of
            Bach’s St. John Passion described as “one of the most satisfying you could ever hope to hear” with a chorus
            “scrupulously prepared.” (Star Tribune) A passionate music educator, Matthew often leads choir festivals and
            recently served as a Visiting Professor at St. Olaf College and a guest conductor at Florida State
            University’s College of Music. </p>
          <p class="justify p-3">In 2024, he was named Minnesota’s Collegiate Music Educator of the Year. His
            award-winning compositions and arrangements are published by Colla Voce, Santa Barbara, and via his website
            www.matthewjolson.com. He studied choral and orchestral conducting at St. Olaf College, The Oregon Bach
            Festival, Michigan State University, The Canford Conducting School (U.K.), and The University of Minnesota.
            Matthew belongs to Beyond Artists, a coalition of artists that donates a percentage of their concert fees to
            non-profits they care about. He proudly supports College Possible.</p>
